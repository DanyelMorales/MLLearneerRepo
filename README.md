# ML Linear Regression from Scratch

In this repository, you'll discover several engaging Jupyter notebooks where you can delve into the fundamentals of Machine Learning, specifically Linear Regression.

I've curated datasets for various topics, including cats, caves, ice cream sales, and earthquake damage (although it doesn't directly apply to linear regression, it serves as a valuable illustration of its limitations).

It's worth noting that my inspiration and learning stemmed from Paolo Perrotta's book, "Programming Machine Learning" (available at https://pragprog.com/titles/pplearn/programming-machine-learning/). You'll find examples like the "pizza" problem within the datasets, along with corresponding Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploring the pizza store scenario.

One novel addition I've incorporated is a method to visualize an animation of the W line as it approximates the values. This visualization aids in comprehending the behavior of the approximation, offering insights into its performance.
